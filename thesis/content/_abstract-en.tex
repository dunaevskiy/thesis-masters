This master's thesis deals with designing and implementing an information system described in the existing bachelor's thesis in microservices architecture.
The goal is to rewrite the original architecture, automatically test and ensure containerization.
Based on the analysis of the area of microservices, suitable variants of the architecture were chosen and adapted.
Due to the scope of the work, some functionality was partially transferred to future development.
In conclusion, the new solution is compared with the previous, and the result is evaluated.
